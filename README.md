# SWAPIClient

*SWAPIClient is an application that is a client of the public Star Wars Universe API - SWAPI. It is written using Swift and UIKit, and is designed to explore various aspects of the Star Wars universe, such as characters, planets, starships, and more.*

**Tech Stack**

- Swift
- UIKit
- URLSession: used to make network requests to the API.
- UISearchController: used to implement the search function in the application.
- JSON Decoding: used to decode JSON responses from the API.
- UICollectionViewController: used to display data lists and provide user interaction.
- The application uses the MVC architecture.

**Features**

- Exploring the Universe: Users can browse various entities from the Star Wars universe, including characters, planets, movies and starships.
- Search: The app includes a search function that allows users to filter entities by name.
- Pagination: When browsing data lists, there is a pagination feature that provides users with a seamless and efficient way to navigate through large data sets.
- Detailed browsing: Users can view detailed information about each entity by clicking on them in the list.

**Achievements**

In developing this app, I was able to achieve several important goals:

- Master working with APIs, including making network queries, parsing JSON, and handling the resulting data.
- Implement pagination and search, which are important features for most data-intensive applications.
- Master the basic capabilities of the UICollectionViewController to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- Combine my passion for Star Wars and application development.
- Since Star Wars photos and images are copyrighted and not provided by the chosen API, I focused on implementing textual data about the Star Wars universe, leaving the application without visualizing that data.
